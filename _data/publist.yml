  description: Leggett Garg inequalities (LGIs) provides an elegant way for probing the incompatibility between the notion of macrorealism and quantum mechanics. For unitary dynamics the optimal quantum violation of a LGI is constrained by the L ders bound. In this paper, we have studied two formulations of LGIs in three-time LG scenario, viz, the standard LGIs and third-order LGIs both for unbiased and biased measurement settings. We show that if system evolves under non-unitary quantum channel between two measurements, the quantum violations of both forms of LGIs exceed their respective L ders bounds and can even reach their algebraic maximum in sharp measurement settings. We found that when the measurement is unsharp the quantum violations of both standard and third-order LGIs for non-unitary quantum channel can be obtained for lower value of the unsharpness parameter compared to the unitary dynamics

- title: "Discriminating mirror symmetric states with restricted contextual advantage"
  image: image.png
  description: The generalized notion of noncontextuality provides an avenue to explore the fundamental departure of quantum theory from a classical explanation. Recently, extracting a different form of quantum advantage in various information processing tasks has received an upsurge of interest. In a recent work [D. Schmid and R. W. Spekkens, Phys. Rev. X 8, 011015 (2018)] it has been demonstrated that discrimination of two nonorthogonal pure quantum states entails contextual advantage when the states are supplied with equal prior probabilities. We generalized the work to arbitrary prior probabilities as well as to three arbitrary mirror-symmetric states. We show that the contextual advantage can be obtained for any value of prior probability when only two quantum states are present in the task. But surprisingly, in the case of three mirror-symmetric states, the contextual advantage is available only for a restrictive range of prior probabilities with which the states are prepared.

- title: "L\"uders bounds of Leggett-Garg inequalities, PT- symmetric evolution and arrow-of-time"
  image: image.png
  description: Leggett Garg inequalities (LGIs) test the incompatibility between the notion of macrorealism and quantum mechanics. For unitary dynamics, the optimal quantum violation of an LGI is constrained by the L\"uders bound. However, the LGIs does not provide the necessary and sufficient for macrorealism. A suitably formulated set of no-signaling in time (NSIT) conditions along with the arrow-of-time (AOT) condition provides the same. In this paper, we study two formulations in the three-time LG scenario, viz., the standard LGIs and the recently formulated variant of LGIs when the system evolves under PT-symmetric Hamiltonian. We first demonstrate that the quantum violations of both forms of LGIs exceed their respective L\"uders bounds and can even reach their algebraic maximum. We further show that for the case of standard LGI, the violation of L\"uders bound can be obtained when both NSIT and AOT conditions are violated. Interestingly, for the case of a variant of LGI, for suitable choices of relevant parameters, the quantum violation can even be obtained when only the AOT is violated but all NSIT conditions are satisfied. This feature has not hitherto been demonstrated. We discuss the further implication of our study.

- title: "Semi-device-independent certification of multiple unsharpness parameters through sequential measurements"
  image: image.png
  description: Based on a sequential communication game, semi-device-independent certification of an unsharp instrument has recently been demonstrated [K. Mohan, A. Tavakoli, and N. Brunner, New J. Phys. 21, 083034 (2019)]. In this paper, we provide semi-device-independent self-testing protocols in the prepare-measure scenario to certify multiple unsharpness parameters along with the states and the measurement settings. This is achieved through the sequential quantum advantage shared by multiple independent observers in a suitable communication game known as the parity-oblivious random-access code. We demonstrate that in the three-bit parity-oblivious random-access code at most three independent observers can sequentially share quantum advantage. The optimal pair (triple) of quantum advantages enables us to uniquely certify the qubit states, the measurement settings, and the unsharpness parameter

- title: "Oblivious communication game, self-testing of projective and nonprojective measurements, and certification of randomness"
  image: image.png
  description: "We provide an interesting two-party parity-oblivious communication game whose success probability is solely determined by the Bell expression. The parity-oblivious condition in an operational quantum theory implies the preparation noncontextuality in an ontological model of it. We find that the aforementioned Bell expression has two upper bounds in an ontological model: the usual local bound and a nontrivial preparation noncontextual bound arising from the nontrivial parity-oblivious condition, which is smaller that the local bound. We first demonstrate the communication game when both Alice and Bob perform three measurements of dichotomic observables in their respective sites. The optimal quantum value of the Bell expression in this scenario enables us to device-independently self-test the maximally entangled state and trine set of observables, three-outcome qubit positive-operator-valued measures and 1 …"

- title: "Direct experimental test of commutation relation via imaginary weak value"
  image: image.png
  description: "The canonical commutation relation is the hallmark of quantum theory, and Heisenberg's uncertainty relation is a direct consequence of it. Although various formulations of uncertainty relations have been tested in experiments a direct test of the commutation relation has hitherto not been performed. The reason for this is that whereas in quantum mechanics, observables are usually represented by Hermitian operators, the product of two noncommuting observables as occurring in the commutator relation is, in general, non-Hermitian. Here, we present a theoretical scheme for a direct test of the commutation relation and report its experimental realization. More precisely, we provide an experimental verification of the canonical commutation relation between two qubit observables based on a measurement scheme widely known as “weak measurement.” In our neutron interferometric setup, we perform the measurement …"

- title: "Symmetric evolution, coherence and violation of Leggett–Garg inequalities"
  image: image.png
  description: "We report an unusual buildup of the quantum coherence in a qubit subjected to non-Hermitian evolution generated by a parity-time (PT) symmetric Hamiltonian, which is reinterpreted as a Hermitian system in a higher dimensional space using Naimark dilation. The coherence is found to be maximum about the exceptional points (EPs), ie the points of coalescence of the eigenvalues as well as the eigenvectors. The nontrivial physics about EPs has been observed in various systems, particularly in photonic systems. As a consequence of enhancement in coherence, the various formulations of Leggett–Garg inequality tests show maximal violation about the EPs."

- title: "Two definitions of maximally ψ-epistemic ontological model and preparation non-contextuality"
  image: image.png
  description: "An ontological model is termed as maximally ψ-epistemic if the overlap between any two quantum states is fully accounted for by the overlap of their respective probability distributions of ontic states. However, in the literature, there exist two different mathematical definitions (termed here as 1MψE and 2MψE) that capture the equivalent notion of maximal ψ-epistemicity. In this work, we provide three theorems to critically examine the connections between preparation non-contextuality and the aforementioned two definitions of maximal ψ-epistemicity. In theorem 1, we provide a simple and direct argument of an existing proof to demonstrate that the mixed state preparation non-contextuality implies the first definition of maximal ψ-epistemicity. In theorem 2, we prove that the second definition of maximal ψ-epistemicity implies pure-state preparation non-contextuality. If both the definitions capture the equivalent notion of …"
